12	Acetylcholine	Differential Diagnosis by Laboratory Medicine by Vincent Marks	abbreviation		ACH
13	Acetylcholine	Differential Diagnosis by Laboratory Medicine by Vincent Marks	general details		A reversible acetic acid ester of choline. It is a cholinergic agonist.
14	Acetylcholine	Differential Diagnosis by Laboratory Medicine by Vincent Marks	production		Synthesized from choline and mitochondrially derived acetylcoenzyme A by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase. ACH is released at a motor neuron end-plate by an electrical impulse travelling down the nerve toward a muscle.
15	Acetylcholine	Differential Diagnosis by Laboratory Medicine by Vincent Marks	Function		The major neurotransmitter of: a) motoneurons (mediates impulse transfer from motoric nerve fibre to striated muscle), b) postganglionIc parasympathetic fibers, c) vegetative sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia of nerve system, d) CNS cholinergic neurons (basal ganglia, motor cortex). ACH acts through muscarine (M) and nicotine (N) receptors. There are 5 types M receptors; M, receptors are localized on parasympathetic nerve endings. Their activation lead to IP3 and DAG production increase with subsequent intracellular Ca'+ level increase leading to gastrointestinal tract secretion and motility increase, as well as CNS excitation. M, receptors are in myocardium and smooth muscles. They decrease cAMP production and open K+ channels resulting in bradycardia, increased ureter and bladder peristalsis. M, receptors are in exocrine glands, smooth muscles and vascular endothelium. They cause bronchial smooth muscle and uterus contraction and bronchial, salivary, lacrimal, and sweat glands secretion increase by intracellular Ca'+ concentration increase. ACH acts on vessels directly with subsequent contraction (after high doses) and secondly indirectly with subsequent dilation (by EDRF release). M, and M, receptors are in CNS, their function is not clear yet. Nicotme NN receptors are localized at the vegetative ganglia level. Na+ and K+ channel openings are active effect mechanisms. Nicotine NM receptors are in skeletal muscles and mediate nerve-muscular transfer from motoric fibre onto skeletal muscle. Acetylcholine levels are regulated by the activity of choline acetyltransferase which hydrolyzes ACH to choline and acetate ion. Choline is back uptaken and enters with acetylcoenzyme A into ACH synthesis cycle.
